## Project Overview

PULSE is a real-time Friend Group Safety Monitor designed for nights out and events.  
Friends can stay connected via the app â€” sharing:

- Location (GPS)
- Vitals data (heart rate, stress level)
- SOS button alerts

If a friend strays too far from the group, shows abnormal vitals, or presses SOS,  
AWS Lambda functions immediately send alerts to all friends via SMS/email.
